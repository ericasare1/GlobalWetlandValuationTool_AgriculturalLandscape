# Introduction

Wetlands are beneficial to society in terms of flood protection, climate regulation and so on. 

# objective

We developed a meta-regression value function that will be able to estimate the value of wetlands on agricultural landscapes, globally. We also investigate the usefulness of meta-regression functions, including ours in benefit transfers.

# Method

We compared a log-linear and a log-log random coefficient models.
